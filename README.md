# 👋 Hi, I'm Bartosz

I'm a 23-year-old frontend developer from Poland with a strong analytical mindset, sometimes *too* strong for my own good 😅. Since childhood, I’ve been fascinated by how things work — fixing computers, phones, and anything tech-related for my entire family. I’ve always loved seeing instant results, which naturally pulled me into frontend development.

## 🧠 How I work

I’m extremely logical and detail-oriented. I like understanding things from the ground up — not just using tools, but knowing *why* they work. I treat AI as a powerful tool and I communicate with it effectively to speed up my development process, validate ideas, and even debug.

## 🛠️ What I’ve built

- 🔧 **Full-stack Car Marketplace** (Python + Django)\
  Built from scratch for a university project. It behaves like a real car selling/buying platform with user authentication, listing creation, and more.

- 📘 **School Management System – Frontend** (React)\
  Built in a month with a colleague for our engineering thesis. I was fully responsible for the frontend part.\

- 🎉 **Event Management Platform**\
  Currently developing a full event app for a 160-person competition in my hometown, including real-time round tracking, user registration, and more — fully designed and implemented by me from scratch.
  Cannot make it public yet cause of NDA.

## 📚 My stack

- JavaScript, React
- HTML, CSS
- Python (Django), Node.js
- Databases (basic SQL and data modeling)
- Postman – for testing and documenting APIs
- Docker – for containerizing apps and local development
- Git & GitHub
- Basic C and C++
- ChatGPT/AI tools – I use them strategically and effectively

## 🎓 Education

I started my studies at **Poznań University of Technology** in Telecommunications & IT, but after almost 2 years realized that deep academic math wasn’t what I needed. I transferred to a different university to study **Computer Science**, where I focused on practical software development.

Last month, I graduated as an **Engineering Bachelor of Computer Science** with the school management system as my final project.

## 💬 A bit more

- I speak English fluently (B2/C1)
- I’m currently looking for a **frontend developer position**
- I thrive in clear logic, instant feedback, and challenging tasks
- I'm a fast learner who enjoys shipping real things, not just writing code
