# 👋 Hi, I'm Bartosz

23-year-old **Web / Full-Stack Developer** from Poland

## 🧠 How I work
Curious, hands-on and highly motivated — I enjoy diving into different domains, understanding *why* things work, and delivering visible results.  
To stay efficient, I automate repetitive steps whenever possible, so I can focus on creative problem-solving.
